Developers often need to expose local services—whether for testing webhooks, integrating with SaaS, or quickly demoing in-progress features—but you don't want them poking holes in your firewall or deploying shadow IT to get the job done.
ngrok lets you define exactly how your developer peers can create these public developer environments, then apply policies like authentication across them consistently.

With this ["front door"](/universal-gateway/examples/front-door-pattern) setup, you can:

- Give each developer their own public URL like `bob.devtest.example.com`.
- Route requests to the right internal service using domain-based matching.
- Apply consistent policies like IP restrictions or mTLS to every developer endpoint from a single gateway.

## What you'll need

- A [production pay-as-you-go](/docs/pricing-limits/) account for creating wildcard domains

## 1. Let developers create endpoints for their services

Each developer can run their own internal Agent Endpoint using a URL that's namespaced to your shared ngrok account, like `bob.internal`, replacing `$PORT` based on where their service listens.
They can also use one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s).

```bash
ngrok http 3000 --url http://bob.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

Navigate to the [**Domains** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) of the ngrok dashboard and click **New +** to reserve a wildcard domain like `*.devtest.example.com`.

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

Navigate to the [**Endpoints** section](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/endpoints?sortBy=updatedAt&orderBy=desc) of the ngrok dashboard, then click **New +** and **Cloud Endpoint**.

In the **URL** field, enter the wildcard domain you just reserved to finish creating your [Cloud Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/cloud-endpoints/).

## 4. Route traffic to developer environments with Traffic Policy
