The "front door" pattern involves using a Cloud Endpoint, the forward-internal Traffic Policy action, and an internal Agent Endpoint to route traffic from the public internet to your service(s).

With this pattern, you can:

- Host any number of services under a single hostname (e.g. `your-company.com`) and route to them by path, subdomain, headers, or more.
- Apply certain policies like authentication at your gateway, then layer in other policies for specific services.
- Prevent your services or their host systems from being exposed to the public internet.
- Route traffic and add authentication to microservices with a single API gateway configuration.
- Authenticate developer environments or CI preview builds behind a single endpoint.

## 1. Create an endpoint for your service

Start an internal [Agent Endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/agent-endpoints/), replacing `$PORT` based on where your service listens.
You can also use one of our [SDKs](/docs/agent-sdks) or the [Kubernetes Operator](/docs/k8s).

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service.internal
```

## 2. Reserve a domain

<ReserveDomain />

## 3. Create a Cloud Endpoint

<CloudEndpoint />

## 4. Add routing to your service with Traffic Policy

While still viewing your new cloud endpoint in the dashboard, copy and paste the policy below into the Traffic Policy editor.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: http://service.internal
```

### What's happening here?

The traffic policy engine forwards all HTTP requests to the internal agent endpoint you created at `https://service.internal`.

## 5. Try out your endpoint

<TryOut />

## Add a second service and routing (optional)

If you have another service to host under the front door pattern, start another agent.

```bash
ngrok http $PORT --url https://service-two.internal
```

### Update your routing based on paths

Copy and paste the policy below into the ngrok dashboard, replacing `/one` and `/two` with the paths you'd like to use for routing traffic to each service.

```yaml
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.includes('/one')"
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: http://service.internal
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.includes('/two')"
    actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: http://service-two.internal
```

### What's happening here?

The traffic policy engine forwards all HTTP requests to the `/one` path to the internal agent endpoint at `https://service.internal` and requests to the `/two` path to `https://service-two.internal`.

## What's next?

- [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy) enables you to do many more things worth your endpoints.
  For example, try adding authentication to your endpoint with the [`oauth` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/oauth) or [`basic-auth` action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/basic-auth) actions.
- View your traffic in [Traffic Inspector](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/traffic-inspector) to find potential issues or observe patterns of traffic you may way to [block using additional policies](/docs/traffic-policy/examples/block-unwanted-requests/) on your Cloud Endpoint.
