title: What are Matching Endpoints?
description: Learn about endpoints that match the domain or TCP address they're created on.
---

A matching endpoint is a public endpoint with a [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname.) matching a [Domain](/universal-gateway/what-are-domains) or [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/what-are-tcp-addresses) you've configured with ngrok.

For example, after you create the Domain `app.example.com`, you can create the [Endpoint](/universal-gateway/endpoints) `https://app.example.com`.

Matching endpoints are subject to the following restrictions:

| Endpoint Protocol | Required Port |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| `http`            | `80`          |
| `https`           | `443`         |
| `tls`             | `443`         |
| `tcp`             | Any           |

:::tip
If you configure your Domain to use [dedicated IPs](/universal-gateway/ip-addresses/#dedicated-ips), these restrictions are removed and you may create matching endpoints on any ports.
