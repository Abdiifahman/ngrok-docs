title: How Do I Select Endpoints for a Cluster?
---

If you don't want all kubernetes endpoints in your account to appear inside of
a cluster, you may specify an Endpoint Selector which filters which Kubernetes
endpoints are projected into the cluster it runs in. Endpoint Selectors are a
CEL expression which is evaluated against each Kubernetes Endpoint in your
account. The operator will only projects endpoints that the selector returns
`true` for.

For example, to only project kubernetes endpoints in the billing namespace, you would
add the following flag when installing the Kubernetes Operator:

```bash
  --set binding.endpointSelector="ep.hostname.endsWith('.billing')" \
```
