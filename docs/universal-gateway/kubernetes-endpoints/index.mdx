Kubernetes endpoints are secure, private endpoints that are only addressable
inside of Kubernetes clusters where you install the [Kubernetes
Operator](/k8s/). They enable you to connect to ngrok endpoints without making them publicly addressable.

Kubernetes endpoints have a [binding](/universal-gateway/bindings) of `kubernetes`.

## Type and Pooling

- Kubernetes endpoints support all [Endpoint
  Types](/universal-gateway/types) (`agent` and `cloud`).
- Kubernetes endpoints support [Endpoint
  Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling).

## Coming Soon

This feature is in developer preview, more documentation is coming soon.

## API

Kubernetes endpoints can be created programatically. Consult the documentation
on [Endpoint APIs](/api/resources/endpoints/).

## Pricing

Kubernetes endpoints are available on the Pay-as-you-go plan. Consult the
[Endpoints Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing)
documentation for billing details.
