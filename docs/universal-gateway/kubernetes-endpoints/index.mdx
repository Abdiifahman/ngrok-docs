title: What are Kubernetes Endpoints?
---

:::info Coming Soon

Kubernetes endpoints are not available yet, [request access to the developer
preview](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview) for early access.

:::

Kubernetes endpoints are secure, private endpoints that are only addressable
inside of Kubernetes clusters where you install the [Kubernetes
Operator](/k8s/). They enable you to connect to ngrok endpoints without making them publicly addressable.

Kubernetes endpoints have a [binding](/universal-gateway/bindings) of `kubernetes`.

## Type and Pooling

- Kubernetes endpoints support all [Endpoint
  Types](/universal-gateway/types) (`agent` and `cloud`).
- Kubernetes endpoints support [Endpoint
  Pooling](/universal-gateway/endpoint-pooling).

## How do I enable or disable Kubernetes endpoints on an existing installation?

By default, if you don't change the default endpoint selector, all endpoints with a Kubernetes binding will be bound to the cluster the Operator is installed on. Changing the binding allows you to restrict which endpoints that operator will handle.

See [the docs on enabling bindings](/docs/k8s/guides/bindings/#enable-bindings-for-the-operator) to learn more.

## API

Kubernetes endpoints can be created programatically. Consult the documentation
on [Endpoint APIs](/api/resources/endpoints/).

## Pricing

Kubernetes endpoints are available on the Pay-as-you-go plan. Consult the
[Endpoints Pricing](/universal-gateway/endpoints/#pricing)
documentation for billing details.
