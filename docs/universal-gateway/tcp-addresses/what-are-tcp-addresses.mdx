title: What are TCP Addresses?
---

TCP Addresses enable you to create public [TCP Endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp/) on a fixed address. TCP Addresses are a combination of a hostname and a port, such as `1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345`.

You can manage TCP Addresses with:

- [The Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tcp-addresses)
  - [Learn how TCP Addresses are assigned](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/how-are-tcp-addresses-assigned/).
- [The API](#api).

:::note
Only TCP Endpoints may be created on TCP Addresses. To create other endpoint
types, create a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/).
:::

## Global Load Balancer

TCP Addresses are not supported by the [global load
balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer).

You must select a [Point of
Presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence) when you create a TCP
Address. Connections to matching TCP Endpoints on a TCP Address will always
route to the TCP Address's point of presence, no matter where those connections
originated in the world.

You may create Agent Endpoints from an agent connected to a different point of
presence than the matching TCP Address. For example, the following will work
properly:

```sh
ngrok tcp 3389 --region jp --url tcp://1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345
```

## API

TCP Addresses are programatically managed via:

- [`/reserved_addrs` API Resource](/api/resources/reserved-addrs/)

## Pricing

TCP Addresses are available on paid plans only, they are not available on the
free plan.
