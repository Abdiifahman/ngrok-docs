title: What is automatic certificate management?
description: Learn how ngrok provisions TLS certificates.
---

Whenever you create a [domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/), ngrok automatically provisions and manages your TLS certificates by default. Your TLS certificates will be automatically provisioned **and renewed** with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/about/), an ACME-compliant certificate authority.

Alternatively, you can [bring your own TLS certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-do-i-use-my-own-certificates) and [use your own certificate authority](/api/resources/certificate-authorities/).

:::tip
It is recommended that you choose automatic TLS certificate management unless you have special requirements.

## Let's Encrypt

ngrok is a [Let's Encrypt sponsor](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/).

When provisioning TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt, ngrok uses a [HTTP01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge) for most domains. When you create a [wildcard domain](#using-wildcard-domains), ngrok uses a [DNS01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) instead.

## How long does provisoning take?

TLS certificates are provisioned asynchronously. Depending on the speed of the ACME certificate authority, it can take anywhere between a few seconds to 10 minutes for your certificate to be provisioned.

You can check the status of a certificate provisioning job by [requesting the domain with ngrok's API](/api/resources/reserved-domains/#get-reserved-domain). Each domain object contains a `certificate_management_status` property.

## Using your own domain

When you [bring your own domain](/universal-gateway/how-do-i-use-my-own-domain) (e.g. `api.your-domain.com`) you must create a `CNAME` DNS record in your DNS provider. Automatic certificate provisioning will not begin until your create this `CNAME` DNS record.

## Using wildcard domains

When you bring your own wildcard domain (e.g. `*.app.example.com`), ngrok uses a DNS01 challenge for TLS certificate provisioning which means that you must create two CNAME records when creating branded wildcard domains instead of just one.

For example, If your domain is `*.app.example.com` you will be required to create the following two CNAME records:

- `*.app.example.com`
- `_acme-challenge.app.example.com`

Certificate provisioning will not begin until you have created both DNS
records.

### Private Keys

When using automatic TLS certificates, ngrok generates a private key for your
domain and encrypts it at rest with with [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

When you configure a domain to use automated certificates, you may electively
choose whether ngrok will create an ECDSA private key (the default) or RSA
private key. If you choose an RSA private key, it is created with a size of
4096 bits.
