title: What is automatic certificate management?
description: Learn how ngrok provisions TLS certificates.
---

Whenever you create a [domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/), ngrok automatically provisions and manages your TLS certificates by default. Your TLS certificates will be automatically provisioned **and renewed** with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/about/), an ACME-compliant certificate authority. Others may be supported in the future.

Alternatively, you can [bring your own TLS certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-do-i-use-my-own-certificates) and [use your own certificate authority](/api/resources/certificate-authorities/).

:::tip
It is recommended that you choose automatic TLS certificate management unless you have special requirements.

## Provisioning with Let's Encrypt

ngrok is a [Let's Encrypt sponsor](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/).

When provisioning TLS certificates with Let's Encrypt, ngrok uses a [HTTP01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#http-01-challenge) for most domains. When you create a [wildcard domain](#using-wildcard-domains), ngrok uses a [DNS01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) instead.

### How long does provisioning take?

TLS certificates are provisioned asynchronously. Depending on the speed of the ACME certificate authority, it can take anywhere between a few seconds to 10 minutes for your certificate to be provisioned.

You can check the status of a certificate provisioning job by [requesting the domain with ngrok's API](/api/resources/reserved-domains/#get-reserved-domain). Each domain object contains a `certificate_management_status` property.

## Using your own domain

When you [bring your own domain](/universal-gateway/how-do-i-use-my-own-domain) (e.g. `api.your-domain.com`), automatic certificate provisioning will not begin until your create a `CNAME` DNS record with your domain provider.

### Using wildcard domains

With wild card domains (e.g. `*.app.example.com`), ngrok uses a [DNS01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) for TLS certificate provisioning. This means you must create two `CNAME` records when adding wildcard domains to your ngrok account.

For example, If your domain is `*.app.example.com` you will be required to create the following two CNAME records:

- `*.app.example.com`
- `_acme-challenge.app.example.com`

Certificate provisioning will not begin until you have created both DNS
records.

### Private Keys

When using automatic TLS certificates, ngrok generates a private key for your
domain and encrypts it [at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest) with [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

When you configure a domain to use automated certificates, you can choose which type of private key will be generated for it. Options include:

- [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) (default)
- [RSA](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>)
  - If you choose an RSA private key, it will be created with a size of `4096` bits.
