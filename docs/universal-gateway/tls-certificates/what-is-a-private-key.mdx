ngrok accepts the following formats for the private key of an uploaded TLS
certificate. This is the `private_key_pem` field in the [TLS Certificate Create
API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

- RSA, in either PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 form.
- ECDSA, in either SEC 1 or PKCS#8 form.
- Ed25519, in PKCS#8 form.

Regardless of the format you choose, the private key must be formatted as ASN.1
DER, encoded as PEM. ngrok will not accept any private keys that are encrypted
(e.g. with DES).

ngrok encrypts your uploaded private keys at rest with
[NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/).

## Using wildcard domains

With wild card domains (e.g. `*.app.example.com`), ngrok uses a [DNS01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) for TLS certificate provisioning. This means you must create two `CNAME` records when adding wildcard domains to your ngrok account.

For example, If your domain is `*.app.example.com` you will be required to create the following two CNAME records:

- `*.app.example.com`
- `_acme-challenge.app.example.com`

Certificate provisioning will not begin until you have created both DNS
records.
