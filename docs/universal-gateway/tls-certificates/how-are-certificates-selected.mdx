title: How are Certificates Selected?
description: Learn how ngrok selects certificates for TLS termination.
---

When TLS connections to an endpoint are terminated, ngrok uses the TLS certificate attached to the [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains) matching the endpoint's URL.

Each [domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) on ngrok has an attached TLS certificate, which you can find by:

- [Fetching the domain object from the API](/api/resources/reserved-domains#request-2)
- [Viewing the domain in the dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)

If the domain object doesn't reference any certificate, or if there is no matching domain object for an endpoint's URL, ngrok selects its own TLS certificate for termination.

You may override the certificate used for TLS termination by explicitly terminating TLS yourself with the [`terminate-tls` traffic policy action](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/).
