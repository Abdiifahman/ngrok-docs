description: Learn how ngrok handles TLS certificates.

ngrok automatically handles TLS (SSL) certificate management and termination
for you with no configuration required in most cases. You can allow ngrok to automatically provision certificates for you, or you can [use your own](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-do-i-use-my-own-certificates).

You can manage TLS certificates with:

- [The Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tls-certs)
- [The API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

## How certificates work

TLS certificates are composed of a private key and certificate. These are presented by the ngrok cloud service during [TLS handshakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake) to terminate TLS connections to [HTTPS endpoints](/universal-gateway/http) and [TLS endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls).

## Certificates with domains

TLS certificates are attached to [domains](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) for [termination of TLS connections to endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/) whose URLs match that domain.

## Pricing

TLS certificates are available on all plans. Bringing your own certificates is available on the Enterprise plan. See the [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for details.
