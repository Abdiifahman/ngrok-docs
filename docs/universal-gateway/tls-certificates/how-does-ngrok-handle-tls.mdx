title: How Does ngrok Handle TLS Certificates?
description: Learn how ngrok handles TLS certificates.

ngrok automatically handles TLS (SSL) certificate management and termination
for you out of the box, but you can also [customize how termination works](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/) and [use your own certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-do-i-use-my-own-certificates).

You can manage TLS certificates with:

- [The Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tls-certs)
- [The API](/api/resources/tls-certificates/).

You can also [specify the local path to a certificate file](/agent/cli/#example-10) when starting a TLS endpoint with the Agent CLI.

## How certificates work

TLS certificates are composed of a private key and certificate. These are presented by the ngrok cloud service during [TLS handshakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#TLS_handshake) to terminate TLS connections to [HTTPS endpoints](/universal-gateway/http) and [TLS endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls).

## Certificates with domains

TLS certificates are attached to [domains](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) for [termination of TLS connections to endpoints](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/) whose URLs match that domain.

## Pricing

TLS certificates are available on all plans. Bringing your own certificates is available on the Enterprise plan. See the [pricing page](https://ngrok.com/pricing) for details.
