title: What are Public Endpoints?
---

A Domain's primary responsibility is to enable you to create [public
endpoints](/universal-gateway/public-endpoints/) with a hostname matching the
domain. These are called "matching endpoints". For example, after you create
the Domain `app.example.com`, you can create the Endpoint
`https://app.example.com`.

When you create a Domain, you may create matching public endpoints with the
following constraints:

| Endpoint Protocol | Allowed Endpoints                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `http`            | Matching endpoints on port `80` of the Domain.                                                   |
| `https`           | Matching endpoints on port `443` of the Domain.                                                  |
| `tls`             | Matching endpoints on port `443` of the Domain.                                                  |
| `tcp`             | Not allowed. Public TCP endpoints must match a [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/). |

If you configure your Domain to use [dedicated IPs](#dedicated-ips), these
restrictions are removed and you may create matching endpoints on any ports.

## Wildcard domains

You may create a Domain with a wildcard name, e.g. `*.example.com`. A wildcard
domain enables you to:

- Create an endpoint which receives traffic for all of its subdomains, e.g.
  `https://*.example.com`. Consult the documentation for [wildcard
  endpoints](/universal-gateway/http/#wildcard-endpoints) to understand
  the rules for matching and precedence.

- Create an endpoint on any subdomain which matches the wildcard, e.g.
  `https://foo.example.com` or `https://foo.bar.baz.example.com`

The wildcard `*` character may only be used as the first part of a
domain, you may not create domains like `app.*.example.com` or
`*-app.example.com`.

## Ownership

Your account exclusively owns its Domains and all of their nested subdomains
within ngrok. That means:

- No account may create a Domain with a name that is a subdomain of your Domains.
- No other account may create endpoints with a hostname matching your Domain or
  any of its nested subdomains.

For example, if you create a Domain with the name `foo.ngrok.app`:

- No other account create the Domains `foo.ngrok.app` or `bar.foo.ngrok.app`.
- No other account may create the endpoints `https://foo.ngrok.app` or `https://bar.foo.ngrok.app`.
