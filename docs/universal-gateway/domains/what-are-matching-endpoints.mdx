title: What are Matching Endpoints?
---

A [Domain's](/universal-gateway/what-are-domains) primary responsibility is to enable you to create [public endpoints](/universal-gateway/public-endpoints/) with a [hostname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname.) matching the domain. These are called "matching endpoints".

For example, after you create the Domain `app.example.com`, you can create the [Endpoint](/universal-gateway/endpoints) `https://app.example.com`.

When you create a Domain, you may create matching public endpoints with the following constraints:

| Endpoint Protocol | Allowed Endpoints                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `http`            | Matching endpoints on port `80` of the Domain.                                                   |
| `https`           | Matching endpoints on port `443` of the Domain.                                                  |
| `tls`             | Matching endpoints on port `443` of the Domain.                                                  |
| `tcp`             | Not allowed. Public TCP endpoints must match a [TCP Address](/universal-gateway/tcp-addresses/). |

::tip
If you configure your Domain to use [dedicated IPs](/universal-gateway/ip-addresses/#dedicated-ips), these restrictions are removed and you may create matching endpoints on any ports.
