title: How do I Use My Own Domain?
---

You can use any domain name that you already own with ngrok, e.g.
`app.your-domain.com`. To do so, you will create a CNAME record for that domain
to point traffic from the domain to ngrok's cloud service. When you create a
Domain, you will be presented with a target value for the CNAME record you need
to create. If you [create the Domain via
API](/api/resources/reserved-domains/), this value is the `cname_target` field.

If you bring your own [wildcard domain](#wildcard-domains), you will need to
create a second DNS CNAME record for [wildcard TLS Certificate
provisioning](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/#wildcard-domains).

ngrok is not a domain registrar; you must already own a domain name to use it
with ngrok.

## Apex domains

If you want to use an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`) with ngrok, you must use
a DNS provider that supports an ALIAS record or CNAME flattening because the
DNS RFC does not permit CNAME records for apex domains. Because of how
ALIAS/CNAME flattening is implemented, apex domains will not take advantage of
the [Global Load Balancer](#global-load-balancer). If you are trying to create
your apex domain because you need to create endpoints for multiple subdomains,
use a [wildcard domain](#wildcard-domains) instead.
