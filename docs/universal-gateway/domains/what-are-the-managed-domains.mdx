title: What are the Managed Domains?
---

If you don't own a domain that you want to use with ngrok, you can create a
Domain that is a subdomain of an ngrok-managed base domain. The ngrok-managed
base domains are:

| Domain             | Availability                                      | HSTS Global Preload |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `ngrok.app`        | Available to paying accounts                      | Yes                 |
| `ngrok.dev`        | Available to paying accounts                      | Yes                 |
| `ngrok.pizza`      | Available to paying accounts                      | No                  |
| `ngrok-free.app`   | Used by free accounts                             | Yes                 |
| `ngrok-free.dev`   | Used by free accounts                             | Yes                 |
| `ngrok-free.pizza` | Used by free accounts (coming soon)               | No                  |
| `ngrok.io`         | Discontinued and only available to older accounts | No                  |

### Public Suffix List

The ngrok-managed base domains are on the [Public Suffix
List](https://publicsuffix.org/). Browsers use the Public Suffix List to
guarantee that cookies from one subdomain cannot be accessed by other
subdomains.

### HSTS Preload

Some of the ngrok-managed base domains are on the global
[HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) preload
list. If the domain of the URL is on the [global HSTS preload
list](https://hstspreload.org/), modern browsers automatically convert requests
with an `http` scheme to `https`.

If you need to create unencrypted `http` endpoints, you should create them with
hostnames that are not on the HSTS Global Preload like `ngrok.io` and
`ngrok.pizza`.

ngrok does not prohibit you from creating `http` endpoints with hostnames whose
base domain is on the global HSTS preload list because non-browser clients
(like `curl`) can still be used to make unencrypted HTTP requests to them.
