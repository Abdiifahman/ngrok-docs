You may create a Domain with a wildcard name, e.g. `*.example.com`. A wildcard domain enables you to:

- Create an endpoint which receives traffic for all of its subdomains, e.g. `https://*.example.com`. See [Wildcard Endpoints](/universal-gateway/http/#wildcard-endpoints) to understand the rules for matching and precedence.
- Create an endpoint on any subdomain which matches the wildcard, e.g. `https://foo.example.com` or `https://foo.bar.baz.example.com`

:::note
The wildcard `*` character may only be used as the first part of a
domain, you may not create domains like `app.*.example.com` or
`*-app.example.com`.

### Wildcard endpoints

You can create an endpoint which will receive traffic for all of the subdomains
matching a given wildcard domain like `*.example.com`. You must create a
[wildcard domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/#wildcard-domains) to create a
public wildcard endpoint.

For example, if you create the wildcard endpoint `https://*.example.com`, it
will receive traffic for `https://foo.example.com` and
`https://bar.example.com`.

- Connections to URLs which match an online wildcard endpoint will be routed to
  it. For example, if you have created a wildcard endpoint
  `https://*.example.com`, connections to `https://foo.bar.baz.example.com` will
  route to it.
- Connections are routed to the most specific online endpoint. For example, if
  the endpoints `https://*.example.com` and `https://app.example.com` are both
  online, a connection to `https://app.example.com` will not be routed to the
  wildcard endpoint.

[Wildcard endpoints](/universal-gateway/wildcard-domains/#wildcard-endpoints) do not pool with non-wildcard URLs. For example, if you have
two endpoints online, `https://foo.example.com` and `https://*.example.com`,
they will not pool together and traffic to `https://foo.example.com` will not
be load balanced. Consult the documentation for [wildcard
endpoints](/universal-gateway/http/#wildcard-endpoints) to understand
the rules for matching and precedence.

### Use multiple endpoints with wildcard subdomains

With the [Agent CLI](/agent/cli), you can create separate public endpoints for subdomains of a wildcard domain no matter where the upstream services are running. See [the Domains docs](/docs/universal-gateway/domains/#wildcard-domains) for more information.

For example, if you reserve `*.example.com` and want to route requests to `api1.example.com` and `api2.example.com`, you can specify subdomains via the CLI. ngrok will handle routing requests to the correct endpoint, even if they're on different ports.

The first one might be at port `80`:

```bash
ngrok http 80 --url https://api1.example.com
```

While the second is at port `81`:

```bash
ngrok http 81 --url https://api2.example.com
```

:::tip
This is only necessary for creating _public_ endpoints to subdomains. Internal endpoints don't require a domain.
:::

### TLS provisioning

When you bring your own wildcard domain (e.g. `*.app.example.com`), ngrok uses
a DNS01 challenge for TLS certificate provisioning which means that you must
create two CNAME records when creating branded wildcard domains instead of just
one.

For example, If your domain is `*.app.example.com` you will be required to create the
following two CNAME records:

- `*.app.example.com`
- `_acme-challenge.app.example.com`

Certificate provisioning will not begin until you have created both DNS
records.

## Pricing

Wildcard domains are available on our Enterprise plan self service. They are also available on Pay-as-You-Go plans if you contact support@ngrok.com. For Pay-as-You-Go when you create a wildcard domain and run endpoints domain `*.foo.com`, endpoints `https://a.foo.com` and `https://b.foo.com`, we bill you for each individual endpoint, which is why we ask that you request the feature.

Reserving subdomains of a wildcard domain within the ngrok dashboard count towards the number of reserved domains in your account. For example, if you reserve `foo.example.com` and `*.example.com`, you have reserved two domains.. You will be charged for each subdomain you use. You may need to enable overages in order to do this on your paid plan.
