title: What are Domains?
---

Domains enable you to create [public endpoints](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-public-endpoints/) with hostnames matching the domain. For example, after you create the domain `your-name.ngrok.app`, you may create the Endpoint `https://your-name.ngrok.app`.

Valid Domain names include:

- [ngrok-managed domains](/docs/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-managed-domains), like `foo.ngrok.app`.
- Your own [custom domains](/docs/universal-gateway/domains/how-do-i-use-my-own-domain/), like `example.your-domain.com`, by creating a `CNAME` DNS record with your domain's DNS provider.

## Configuration

Domains also enable you to configure other domain-level behaviors, including:

- [**Global Load Balancer configuration**](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/#domains) - Choose which points of presence handle traffic to a Domain's matching endpoints.

  :::
- [**TLS Certificate management**](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/) - Configure automatic certificate provisioning or select a certificate you uploaded yourself.
- [**Dedicated IP address configuration**](/universal-gateway/ip-addresses#dedicated-ips) - Attach static, dedicated IPs for a Domain's matching endpoints receive traffic on.

You can manage Domains on your [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) or via the [ngrok API](#api).

- [`/reserved_domains` API Resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains/)
