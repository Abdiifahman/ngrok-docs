title: What are Domains?
---

Domains enable you to create public endpoints with hostnames matching the
domain. For example, after you create the domain `your-name.ngrok.app`, you may create the Endpoint `https://your-name.ngrok.app`

Domain names may be a subdomain of an [ngrok-managed
domain](#ngrok-managed-domains) like `foo.ngrok.app` or you can [bring your own domain](#branded-domains) like `example.your-domain.com` by creating a CNAME DNS record with your domain's DNS provider.

Domains also enable you to configure other domain-level behaviors including:

- [**Global Load Balancer configuration**](#global-load-balancer) - Choose which points of presence handle traffic to a Domain's matching endpoints.
- [**TLS Certificate management**](#tls-certificates) - Configure automatic certificate provisioning or select a certificate you uploaded yourself.
- [**Dedicated IP address configuration**](#dedicated-ips) - Attach static, dedicated IPs for a Domain's matching endpoints receive traffic on.

You can manage Domains on your [ngrok Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains)
or via the [ngrok API](#api).

## Global Load Balancer

The [Global Load Balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer)
uses latency-aware DNS records to direct clients to the IPs of the nearest
[points of presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/).

Domains allow you to configure which points of presence the Global Load
Balancer may resolve clients to. This allows you to select which points of
presence will receive traffic for the Domain's matching endpoints. To disable
the Global Load Balancer, you may configure a domain to only resolve a single
point of presence.

:::info Coming Soon

Per-region global load balancer configuration is coming soon, [request access
to the developer preview](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview).

## TLS Certificates

Domains manage the [TLS Certificate](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/) used
to terminate TLS connections to the Domain's matching endpoints. When you
create a Domain, you may choose to allow ngrok to automatically provision TLS
certificates for you or to upload your own TLS certificate.

Consult the documentation on [TLS
Certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/) for additional details on
certificate provisioning and management.

## Dedicated IPs

By default, a Domain's matching Endpoints receive traffic on a set of
multi-tenant [IP addresses](/universal-gateway/ip-addresses) that are
shared among all ngrok accounts. You may instead configure a Domain's matching
endpoints to receive traffic on IP addresses that are dedicated to your
account.

If your Domain uses dedicated IPs, you may create public endpoints on _any_
port numbers, not just 80 and 443.

:::info Coming Soon

Dedicated, static IPs for your domains are coming soon, [request access to the
developer preview](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview).

## API

Domains are programatically managed via:

- [`/reserved_domains` API Resource](/api/resources/reserved-domains/)

## Pricing

Domains are available on all plans. Some Domain features require upgrades. See
