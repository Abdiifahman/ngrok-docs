title: What are TCP Addresses?
---

TCP Addresses enable you to create public [TCP Endpoints](/universal-gateway/tcp/) on a fixed address. TCP Addresses are a combination of a hostname and a port, such as `1.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:12345`.

You can manage TCP Addresses with:

- [The Dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/tcp-addresses)
- [The API](/api/resources/reserved-addrs/)

:::note
Only TCP Endpoints may be created on TCP Addresses. To create other endpoint
types, create a [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/).

## Global Load Balancer

ngrok does not support global load balancing for TCP Addresses, but you can connect TCP Addresses to Agent Endpoints in different [Points of Presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence).

See [the global load balancer documentation](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer#tcp-addresses) for more information.

## Pricing

TCP Addresses are available on paid plans only, they are not available on the
free plan.
