title: How Does ngrok TLS Termination Work?
description: Learn how ngrok optimizes TLS termination to give your apps better performance.
---

The ngrok cloud service has multiple built-in optimizations for [TLS termination](/universal-gateway/tls/tls-termination/).

## Acceleration

The ngrok cloud service improves the performance of your endpoints by
accelerating TLS termination using ngrok's [global points
of presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence).

TLS connection set-up requires multiple network round-trips. When round-trip
times (RTTs) are long, TLS connection establishment slows down. ngrok reduces
the latency of these round-trip times between the client and your endpoint by
terminating connections at the closest [point of
presence](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) via its [global load
balancer](/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer).

## FIPS Compliance

ngrok does not use a [FIPS-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2) TLS implementation by default, but one can
be enabled for your endpoints.

[Contact us](mailto:support@ngrok.com) if you require a FIPS-compliant TLS
implementation.

## End-to-end encryption

You may choose to terminate TLS at your upstream service or at the ngrok agent
to achieve end-to-end encryption (E2EE), often referred to as Zero-knowledge TLS. When your endpoints operate in this
mode, the ngrok cloud service can not see the payloads that transfer through
your endpoints.

Creating an endpoint with end-to-end encryption is simple:

- Create a TLS or TCP endpoint
- **Do not** add a `terminate-tls` action to its traffic policy.

That's it! Read the [Agent TLS Termination
Guide](/agent/agent-tls-termination/) for a step by step approach to set it up.

To set up the agent to terminate TLS for you, consult the following table
because the configuration depends on which kind of agent you are using.
