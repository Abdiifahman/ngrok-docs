# TLS Termination

ngrok automatically handles TLS (SSL) termination and certificate management
for you. There is typically nothing to setup, configure or manage.

## Overview

ngrok's TLS termination behavior is determined by an endpoint's protocol and
traffic policy. You may customize each endpoint to choose where TLS is
terminated, how it is terminated and even whether it is terminated at all. When
ngrok's cloud service terminates TLS, it:

- Uses latest and most secure version of TLS
- Uses the [TLS
  Certificate](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-does-ngrok-handle-tls/) attached to the
  [Domain](/universal-gateway/domains/what-are-domains/) which matches the Endpoint URL's
  hostname
- Accelerates your traffic by using the global load balancer to terminate at its
  closest point of presence

ngrok supports [end-to-end encryption](#end-to-end-encryption) where the ngrok
cloud service does not terminate TLS connections and only sees enciphered
traffic. When configured this way, you are responsible for configuring TLS
termination in your upstream service or at the ngrok agent.

## How is TLS terminated by default?

An endpoint's protocol determines the ngrok cloud service's default TLS
termination behavior.

| Endpoint Protocol                 | TLS Termination                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [HTTP](/universal-gateway/http/)  | None                                                      |
| [HTTPS](/universal-gateway/http/) | Always at ngrok's cloud service.                          |
| [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/)    | Default no termination, configurable with `terminate-tls` |
| [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/)    | Default no termination, configurable with `terminate-tls` |

## Learn more

- **Using Traffic Policy** — The [`terminate-tls` Traffic Policy
  Action](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls) enables you to terminate TLS
  connections at ngrok's cloud service for TCP and TLS endpoints.
- **Optimizations** — Learn about ngrok's [TLS termination optimizations](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/termination-mechanics/) and how they can improve the performance of your TLS endpoints.
- **Certificates** — ngrok makes managing TLS certificates simple. See [the TLS Certificates documentation](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-does-ngrok-handle-tls/) for more details on how they are [selected](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-are-certificates-selected), managed, provisioned and renewed.
- **End-to-end encryption** — Enabling end-to-end encryption for TLS endpoints is straightforward. See the docs on [how TLS termination works](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/termination-mechanics/#end-to-end-encryption) to learn more.

## Limits & Pricing

TLS endpoints are available on Pay-as-you-go, Pro, and Enterprise plans. Consult the [pricing](/pricing-limits/) documentation for general billing details.

For TLS limits, see the [endpoint Limits documentation](/pricing-limits/endpoint-limits/).
