title: How Do I Terminate TLS?
description: Learn how to terminate TLS with ngrok.

import ConfigExample from "/src/components/ConfigExample.tsx";

You can configure TLS termination for HTTPS, TCP, and TLS endpoints with ngrok. By default, ngrok automatically terminates TLS for HTTPS endpoints, but you can still customize how that termination is done using the [`terminate-tls`](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls/) Traffic Policy action.

TLS (SSL) certificate management is automatically handled for you by default for all endpoints, though you can also [bring your own TLS certificates](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/bring-your-own-certs/).

## How is TLS terminated by default?

An endpoint's protocol determines the ngrok cloud service's default TLS
termination behavior.

| Endpoint Protocol                 | TLS Termination                                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [HTTP](/universal-gateway/http/)  | None                                                      |
| [HTTPS](/universal-gateway/http/) | Always at ngrok's cloud service.                          |
| [TLS](/universal-gateway/tls/)    | Default no termination, configurable with `terminate-tls` |
| [TCP](/universal-gateway/tcp/)    | Default no termination, configurable with `terminate-tls` |

## Example

This example sets the minimum and maximum TLS versions that the endpoint will support for incoming connections to TLS version 1.3. Clients can then only connect to the endpoint using TLS version 1.3 and will receive a handshake error if they attempt to connect using a different version.

### **Step 1** — Create a Traffic Policy

<ConfigExample
	snippetText={null}
	showLineNumbers={true}
	jsonMetastring="{5-11}"
	yamlMetastring="{4-7}"
	config={{
		on_tcp_connect: [
			{
				actions: [
					{
						type: "terminate-tls",
						config: {
							min_version: "1.3",
							max_version: "1.3",
						},
					},
				],
			},
		],
	}}
/>

### **Step 2** — Start an endpoint

```shell
ngrok http 8080 --url https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --traffic-policy-file /path/to/policy.yml
```

### **Step 3** — Make a request

```shell
curl https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app
```

If your curl was built with a version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.3, the request will succeed. However, we can verify that the endpoint only supports TLS 1.3 by telling curl to use a different version of TLS:

```shell
curl https://terminate-tls-example.ngrok.app --tlsv1.2 --tls-max 1.2
```

You should receive an "alert protocol version" error indicating that the endpoint only supports TLS 1.3.

## Learn more

- **Using Traffic Policy** — The [`terminate-tls` Traffic Policy
  Action](/traffic-policy/actions/terminate-tls) enables you to terminate TLS
  connections at ngrok's cloud service for TCP and TLS endpoints.
- **Behavior** — Learn about [how ngrok's TLS termination works](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/termination-mechanics/), and how its built-in optimizatiions can improve the performance of your TLS endpoints.
- **Certificates** — ngrok makes managing TLS certificates simple. See [the TLS Certificates documentation](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-does-ngrok-handle-tls/) for more details on how they are [selected](/universal-gateway/tls-certificates/how-are-certificates-selected), managed, provisioned and renewed.
- **End-to-end encryption** — Enabling end-to-end encryption for TLS endpoints is straightforward. See the docs on [how TLS termination works](/universal-gateway/tls-termination/termination-mechanics/#end-to-end-encryption) to learn more.

## Limits & Pricing

TLS endpoints are available on Pay-as-you-go, Pro, and Enterprise plans. Consult the [pricing](/pricing-limits/) documentation for general billing details.

For TLS limits, see the [endpoint Limits documentation](/pricing-limits/endpoint-limits/).
