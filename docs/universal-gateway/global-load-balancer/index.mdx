title: What is the Global Load Balancer?
description: Learn about how ngrok's Global Load Balancer and how it improves the performance and resiliency of your applications.
---

ngrok's Global Load Balancer improves the performance and resiliency of your
applications by distributing traffic to the point of presence with the least latency from the client, and away from failing points of presence and upstream services.

Every application you deliver with ngrok is automatically accelerated with our always-on, zero-configuration global load balancer.

Global lobal balancing is sometimes called 'Global Server Load Balancing' or
GSLB.

## vs. Traditional GSLBs

ngrok operates differently from a traditional GSLB to give you some important
benefits.

1. In a traditional GSLB deployment, you are responsible for running geographically redundant copies of your application and configuring networking technologies to distribute and failover traffic among these deployments. By contrast, ngrok runs a [global delivery network of PoPs](/universal-gateway/points-of-presence/) for you. This means that even if you only deploy your upstream service to a single geography, your apps still get faster from [Connection Acceleration](#connection-acceleration) and [Module Acceleration](#module-acceleration).
1. Unlike a traditional GSLB deployment, when you deploy your application services to a new geographic location, ngrok automatically routes nearby traffic to those services without any configuration. Traditional GSLB deployments require many network configuration updates to bring these new locations online like IP provisioning and DNS record changes. With ngrok, there is zero configuration, just start your new application services with their ngrok agents and you're done.
1. Unlike a traditional reverse proxy, ngrok forwards traffic to your upstream services over secure connections established by the [ngrok agent](/agent/), [Agent SDKs](/agent-sdks) or [Kubernetes Controller](/k8s/). So which PoPs do those agents connect to? ngrok also applies GSLB principles to those connections as well to ensure that your agents connect to the geographically closest PoPs.
