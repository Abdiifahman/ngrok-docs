This getting started guide will walk you through installing the ngrok Kubernetes
Operator onto your cluster and configuring ingress to a Kubernetes service so
that anyone can access it. We'll include an example deployment, but you could
also use a Kubernetes service you already have running.

import Installation from "../k8s/installation/_installation.mdx";

<Installation />

import Quickstart from "../k8s/guides/quickstart.mdx";

<Quickstart />

## What's next?

Once you have ingress to Kubernetes handled, there's still so much more you can
do with ngrok.

- Understand ngrok's core [endpoint](/docs/universal-gateway/endpoints/)
	concepts, along with features that make our Kubernetes ingress unique, like [DDoS protection](/docs/universal-gateway/ddos-protection/) and a [global load balancer](/docs/universal-gateway/global-load-balancer/).
- Explore the rest of our [Kubernetes ingress docs](/docs/k8s/).
- Learn about [Traffic Policy](/docs/traffic-policy), our engine for filtering,
	managing, and orchestrating traffic.
- Follow comprehensive tutorials on configuring ngrok as [your next API
	gateway](/docs/guides/api-gateway/kubernetes) or [multicloud API
	gateway](/docs/guides/api-gateway/multicloud).
