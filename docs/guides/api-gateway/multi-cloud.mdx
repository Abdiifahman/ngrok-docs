# Deploy a multi-cloud API gateway

You've developed a world-class API, and now you want to make it available online on not just one cloud provider, but two or more.

Aside from the challenges involved in any multi-cloud deployment, you're looking
for a multi-cloud API gateway that allows you to consistently apply security and
traffic management policy in one place, provide a single pane of glass for
observability, fail-over automatically, and work identically in every cloud or environment.

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement ngrok as a multi-cloud API gateway
with these broad steps:

1. Set up the common pattern of cloud and internal agent endpoints, which uses a single cloud endpoint to accept all API traffic and route it to internal agent endpoints via the [`forward-internal` Trafic Policy action](/docs/traffic-policy/actions/forward-internal.mdx).
2. Use endpoint pooling to enable dead-simple load balancing between your API services.
3. Apply Traffic Policy rules to your endpoints to manage traffic according to common API gateway use cases.

:::info
This guide uses endpoint pools, which are not yet generally available. To use them, you must [request access to the developer preview](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/developer-preview).

## What you'll need

- **An ngrok account**: [Sign up](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) for for
  free if you don't already have one.
- **Your authtoken**: [Create an
  authtoken](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/authtokens) using the ngrok dashboard.
- **A reserved domain**: [Reserve a domain](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/domains) in
  the ngrok dashboard or using the [ngrok
  API](/docs/api/resources/reserved-domains/#create-reserved-domain). You can
  choose from an ngrok subdomain or bring your own [custom branded
  domain](/docs/guides/other-guides/how-to-set-up-a-custom-domain.mdx), like `https://api.example.com`. We'll
  refer to this domain as `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}` throughout the guide.
- **The ngrok agent**: [Download](https://download.ngrok.com) the appropriate
  version and install it on the same machine or network as the API service you
  want to make available via ngrok's API gateway.
- (optional) **An API key**: [Create an ngrok API
  key](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/api-keys/new) using the ngrok dashboard if
  you'd like to use the ngrok API to manage your multi-cloud API gateway setup.

## Deploy a demo API service (optional)

If you don't yet have API services you'd like to bring online with a multi-cloud API gateway, or just want to quickly wire up a POC using ngrok, we recommend running multiple "replicas" of [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/), which is simple HTTP request and response service.

Assuming you have Docker installed on the systems where your API services run, you can deploy an httpbin container listening on port `8080`.

```shell
docker run -p 8080:80 -d kennethreitz/httpbin
```

Repeat this process on your other cloud providers where you want to run replicas of your API service.

## Bring your multi-cloud API gateway online

### Create internal agent endpoints to add API services to an endpoint pool

When your create two endpoints with the same URL (and binding), those endpoints
automatically form a "pool" and share incoming traffic. For handling API traffic
in a multi-cloud environment, you'll create two internal agent endpoints on the
same URL to form the pool and load balance traffic between them automatically—no
complex networking or cloud-specific tools required.

In one cloud, create an internal agent endpoint on an internal URL, like
`https://api.internal`. Replace `8080` with for an API service you've brought
yourself.

```
ngrok http 8080 --url https://api.internal
```

Repeat the process for additional replicas of your API service in other clouds.

```
ngrok http 8080 --url https://api.internal
```

These two internal agent endpoints are now in a single endpoint pool, and
traffic is automatically load balanced between them.

### Create a Traffic Policy file to forward traffic

The internal agent endpoints you just created—and the endpoint pool that handles
load balancing between them—are not yet addressable on the public internet.

For that, you need a Traffic Policy rule that species a `forward-internal`
action and the URL to an internal endpoint where traffic should be forwarded.

Create a file called `multi-cloud-policy.yaml` and paste the YAML below.

```yaml title="multi-cloud-policy.yaml" mode=traffic-policy
---
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: forward-internal
        config:
          url: https://api.internal
          binding: internal
```

You'll use this Traffic Policy file in the next step.

### Create a cloud endpoint for your API

Cloud endpoints are persistent, always-on endpoints that you can manage with the ngrok dashboard or API.

You centrally control your traffic management and security policy on this cloud endpoint, then forward traffic to your endpoint pool, rather than trying to apply policy separately for each replica and cloud.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="Dashboard">

    	First, log into the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com). Click **Endpoints &rarr; + New**.

    	Leave the **Binding** value **Public**, then enter the domain name you reserved earlier. Click **Create Cloud Endpoint**.

    	With your cloud endpoint created, you'll see a default Traffic Policy in the dashboard. Open up your `multi-cloud-policy.yaml` file, copy its contents, and paste them into the editor. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="API">

    	The `ngrok` CLI provides a helpful wrapper around the [ngrok API](/docs/api/index.mdx) to simplify its usage.

    	Create a cloud endpoint on `{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}`, passing your `multi-cloud-policy.yaml` file as an option.

    	```shell
    	ngrok api endpoints create \
      --bindings public \
      --url https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}
        --traffic-policy "$(cat multi-cloud-policy.yaml)"
    	```

    	You'll get a `201` response—save the value of `id`, as you'll need it again later to continue configuring the Traffic Policy applied to your cloud endpoint.

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Access your API services

At this point, you have a front door to your multi-cloud API gateway with a cloud endpoint, which in turn forwards traffic to your endpoint pool for automatic load balancing between clouds.

If you're running httpbin as a demo API service, send a query to the `/get` route—if you've brought your own service, change the route accordingly.

```bash
curl -X GET https://{YOUR_NGROK_DOMAIN}/get
```

With httpbin, you'll see a response like:

## Manage multi-cloud API traffic with Traffic Policy rules

### Add security policy across your multi-cloud API gateway

### Add rate limiting for all API services

### Compose policies on specific API services

TK

## Define custom load balancing strategies with endpoint pools

TK

## Extend your multi-cloud API gateway with additional services

So far, you've deployed multiple replicas of a single API service and added automatic load balancing with an endpoint pool.

What if you have more than one API service you'd like to make available behind a
multi-cloud API gateway? You'll need to add additional `forward-internal`
actions and implement a strategy for routing to different upstream services
based on the qualities of incoming requests.
