Explore a curated collection of examples and configuration examples spanning from common to unconventional use cases for the Traffic Policy module.

A number of these examples come from a longer article about how ngrok [makes policy management accessible](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/api-gateway-policy-management-examples) to developers, including a simple Go-based application for testing these and other configurations.

## Manipulate headers

### Enrich your upstream service

Add new headers to requests to give your upstream service more context about the
consumer, which in turn allows for richer functionality, such as localized
languages and pricing.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - actions:
      - type: add-headers
        config:
          headers:
						x-is-ngrok: "1"
            x-endpoint-id: "${endpoint.id}"
            x-client-ip: "${conn.client_ip}"
            x-client-conn-start: "${conn.ts.start}"
            x-client-loc: "${conn.geo.city}, ${conn.geo.country}"
            x-client-path: "${req.url.path}
```

### Remove service details from response headers

Some frameworks, like [Express](https://expressjs.com/), add headers like
`X-Powered-By: Express` to responses, which you may not want to reveal to your
users.

The following example removes the `X-Powered-By` header.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_response:
  - actions:
      - type: remove-headers
        config:
          headers:
            - "X-Powered-By"
```

### Deploy simple A/B tests

Using the [`rand.double()`
macro](/docs/traffic-policy/macros/utility#randdouble--double) set to `>=
0.5`, you can equally split incoming requests to two different internal agent
endpoints, which forward traffic to the two versions of your service.

You can manipulate `<= 0.5` to match the percentage of requests to route to your
B test, e.g. `<= 0.1` for 10%.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
---
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "rand.double() <= 0.5"
    actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: https://b.internal
  - actions:
      - type: "forward-internal"
        config:
          url: https://a.internal
```

If you don't have multiple services, you could also route B traffic to a
separate route.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
---
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "rand.double() <= 0.5"
    actions:
      - type: "url-rewrite"
        config:
					from: "/path/to/test"
          to: "/path/to/test-b"
```

### Create 'pretty' URLs for SEO

You can map the permalinks created by a blog CMS to "pretty" alternatives that
are easier for both humans and [SEO
bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) to
understand.

The following rule rewrites the a user-friendly URL like
`/blog/11/example-title` to `/blog/index.php?p=11&title=example-title`, which is
readable by your CMS.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/blog')"
    actions:
      - type: "url-rewrite"
        config:
          from: "/blog/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)/"
          to: "/blog/index.php?p=$1&title=$2"
```

### User agent filtering

We deliver tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by examining the
`User-Agent` header for the case-insensitive string `(?i)edg/` succeeded by
digits `\d`. To see how this works in practice, explore the following
[regex101 demonstration](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

To ensure correct decoding from YAML/JSON, it's necessary to properly escape the
`\d` sequence. In YAML, if your string is not enclosed in quotes, use a single
escape: `\\d`. However, when your string is wrapped in quotes, either in YAML or
JSON, you need to double-escape: `\\\\d` for accurate decoding.

### Deprecate an API version

By include a `X-Api-Version` header in your API reference or developer documentation, you can quickly return a helpful error message, which encourages them to explore usage of the new version.

<DeprecateVersion />

### Manipulate request headers

### Add compression

Quickly ensure all JSON responses are [compressed](/docs/http/traffic-policy/actions/compress-response.mdx) en route to your API consumer. If your upstream service already handles compression, ngrok skips this step.

<AddCompression />

### Enforce TLS version

Prevent obsolete and potentially vulnerable browsers, SDKs, or CLI tools like `curl` from attempting to access your API.

<EnforceTLS />

### Log unsuccessful events

Connect your API to ngrok's [event logging system](/docs/obs/index.mdx) for smarter troubleshooting of your API gateway and upstream services.

<LogUnsuccessful />
