### User agent filtering

We deliver tailored content to Microsoft Edge users by examining the
`User-Agent` header for the case-insensitive string `(?i)edg/` succeeded by digits `\d`. To see how this works in practice, explore the following [regex101 demonstration](https://regex101.com/r/3NPVub/1).

To ensure correct decoding from YAML/JSON, it's necessary to properly escape the
`\d` sequence. In YAML, if your string is not enclosed in quotes, use a single
escape: `\\d`. However, when your string is wrapped in quotes, either in YAML or
JSON, you need to double-escape: `\\\\d` for accurate decoding.
