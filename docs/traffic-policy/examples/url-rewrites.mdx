### Create 'pretty' URLs for SEO

You can map the permalinks created by a blog CMS to "pretty" alternatives that
are easier for both humans and [SEO
bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) to
understand.

The following rule rewrites the a user-friendly URL like
`/blog/11/example-title` to `/blog/index.php?p=11&title=example-title`, which is
readable by your CMS.

```yaml mode=traffic-policy
on_http_request:
  - expressions:
      - "req.url.path.startsWith('/blog')"
    actions:
      - type: "url-rewrite"
        config:
          from: "/blog/([0-9]+)/([a-zA-Z]+)/"
          to: "/blog/index.php?p=$1&title=$2"
```
